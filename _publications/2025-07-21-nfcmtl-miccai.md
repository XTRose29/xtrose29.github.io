Proposed the first multi-task learning framework for nailfold capillaroscopy, integrating segmentation, classification, and keypoint detection into a unified model. Leveraging a Multiscale Vision Transformer (MViT) backbone with uncertainty-weighted task heads, NFCMTL achieves sub-pixel accuracy in capillary parameter estimation and outperforms prior single-task baselines.
